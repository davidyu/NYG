MTA/Subway Sim - like Railroad Tycoon except you control when trains shut down, whether to fix them, etc

MTA/Subway Quest - travel around the city and run errands while using the MTA. Difficult because we need so much art. And think about whether or not you want to do collision detection! So much work if we do this. Definitely make this simpler.

Live in NY - you're a white collar worker trying to get through life in the city that never sleeps. You are invited to a series of events (cultural, relaxing, work-related) and you choose how to spend your time.

Ticket Officer - you're a police officer giving tickets to the good citizens of New York. The longer you wait, the more money you get. The more likely they are to get away.
